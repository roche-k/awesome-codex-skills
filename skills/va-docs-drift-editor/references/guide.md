# Domain guide

Apply the relevant sections to the actual request. This adapted source is
a menu of domain considerations, not a requirement to perform every item.
Source version numbers and numeric targets are historical examples; use the
project's real versions and agreed acceptance criteria. Check current primary
documentation before relying on external APIs, standards, or provider behavior.
Tool labels describe operations and do not grant unavailable tools or services.

## Expertise areas

- Minimal-diff Markdown editing that preserves existing structure, tone, and register
- Guarding against LLM-invented install commands, URLs, version numbers, and unverified features
- Heading-hierarchy and link-anchor preservation across renames
- Working inside an isolated git worktree so edits never touch the caller's working tree directly
- Producing a machine-readable edit report a downstream merge/curator step can consume

## Required inputs

- The code diff that triggered the edit (file paths + unified diff hunks)
- The list of drifted pages to touch, each with a path and a reason (typically from a searcher/planner agent upstream)
- The worktree path where edits should land

## Core capabilities

1. **Scoped editing** — edit only the files explicitly listed as drifted. Never open or modify a file outside that list, even if it looks related.
2. **Blast-radius guard** — before editing, read the file and count its lines. If the planned edit would touch more than ~40% of the file, stop: leave a `<!-- TODO(docs-sync): section needs manual review after <symbol> was changed -->` marker instead of a substantive rewrite, and report the page as skipped rather than edited.
3. **Structural preservation** — never add, remove, or reorder headings. Edit only the content under them. If a heading's text changes, keep the old anchor alive as an HTML comment (`<!-- anchor: old-anchor -->`) directly below the new heading so existing inbound links don't break.
4. **Zero-hallucination guardrail** — never invent a CLI install command, URL, or version number. Only use one if it appears verbatim in the diff, the project's README/package.json, or the page being edited. If the source material is vague ("users get this via the X plugin"), write a pointer ("See the X README for setup") instead of guessing a command.
5. **Register consistency** — match the existing tone of the page (formal stays formal, casual stays casual) and preserve code-fence language tags.
6. **Machine-readable report** — after all edits, emit a single JSON object and nothing else, so a downstream curator/merge agent can consume it without parsing prose.

## Example usage

**Input (from orchestrator):**
> Diff: `src/lib/auth/session.ts` renames `createSession` → `initSession`. Drifted pages: `docs/api/sessions.md` (confidence 0.82, reason: "documents createSession by name"). Worktree: `/tmp/docs-drift-wt-3`.

**Agent behavior:**
1. Reads `docs/api/sessions.md` inside the worktree, counts lines.
2. Finds two code examples calling `createSession` and updates them to `initSession`, leaving surrounding prose untouched.
3. Verifies no heading text or anchor needed to change.
4. Emits: `{"edited":[{"path":"docs/api/sessions.md","reason":"Renamed createSession to initSession in two code examples"}],"skipped":[]}`

## Best practices

- Prefer the smallest edit that makes the page accurate again — a renamed symbol or a removed-API note, not a paragraph rewrite.
- Treat the diff as the single source of truth for what changed; treat the existing page as the source of truth for how it's written.
- When in doubt between editing and skipping, skip and leave a TODO — a stale-but-honest page beats a confidently wrong one.
- Never use `Write` to replace a whole file; always use targeted `Edit` operations so the diff a human reviews stays small and legible.
