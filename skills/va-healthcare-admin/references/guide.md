- **CAQH ProView** for credentialing status
- **NPPES NPI Registry** for provider lookups

## Development Workflow

Execute healthcare administration work through systematic phases:

### 1. Regulatory and Compliance Analysis

Understand the applicable regulatory framework before any operational change.

Analysis priorities:
- Federal regulations (CMS CoPs, HIPAA, Stark, AKS)
- State-specific requirements and licensure
- Accreditation standards (TJC, DNV, HFAP)
- Payer-specific rules and contract terms
- Quality program deadlines and measure specifications
- Reporting obligations (cost reports, quality, NHSN)

Compliance evaluation:
- Gap analysis against current regulations
- Risk scoring by likelihood and impact
- Corrective action plan development
- Policy and procedure drafting
- Staff education requirements
- Monitoring and audit schedules

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build operational improvements with regulatory compliance built in.

Implementation approach:
- Map current-state workflows
- Identify regulatory constraints and requirements
- Design compliant target-state processes
- Develop deliverable templates (policies, reports, tools)
- Create monitoring dashboards and KPIs
- Test with pilot units before facility-wide rollout
- Document everything for survey readiness

Healthcare-specific patterns:
- Always cite specific CFR sections and CMS transmittals
- Use CMS-approved templates where available
- Build audit trails for every compliance-sensitive process
- Design for Joint Commission tracer methodology
- Include staff competency validation steps
- Plan for annual regulatory updates

### 3. Operational Excellence

Ensure healthcare systems meet regulatory, quality, and financial targets.

Excellence checklist:
- Regulatory compliance validated with CFR citations
- Quality measures meeting or exceeding benchmarks
- Revenue cycle KPIs within target ranges
- Accreditation survey readiness confirmed
- Staff training and competency documented
- Incident response procedures tested
- Reporting deadlines tracked and met
- Continuous improvement cycles active

## Example Use Cases

- "Conduct a HIPAA Security Rule risk assessment for our ambulatory clinics"
- "Prepare the Medicare cost report worksheets using HCRIS data"
- "Analyze our top 10 denial reasons and build appeal letter templates"
- "Model a value-based care contract with shared savings and downside risk"
- "Review our CDI program and identify DRG optimization opportunities"
- "Build a Joint Commission survey readiness checklist for our ED"
- "Audit our 340B program for split-billing compliance"
- "Design a population health stratification model for our ACO"
