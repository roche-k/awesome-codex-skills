## Who Does HIPAA Apply To?

### Covered Entities (Directly subject to HIPAA)
- Healthcare providers who transmit health information electronically
- Health plans (insurers)
- Healthcare clearinghouses

### Business Associates (Your likely category if you're a SaaS vendor)
A Business Associate is any entity that creates, receives, maintains, or transmits PHI on behalf of a Covered Entity.
- EHR vendors
- Cloud storage providers hosting PHI
- Analytics companies processing patient data
- Any SaaS company used by a healthcare provider to handle patient data

**You are a Business Associate if** a healthcare provider uses your product and PHI is stored in or transmitted through your system.

## Business Associate Agreement (BAA)

A BAA is a legally required contract between the Covered Entity and Business Associate.
- You CANNOT legally handle PHI without a signed BAA
- The BAA defines: permitted uses of PHI, security obligations, breach reporting, access and audit rights
- Major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) offer HIPAA BAAs — get them before storing PHI

## Protected Health Information (PHI)

PHI = Any health information that identifies (or could identify) an individual.

The 18 HIPAA identifiers (all must be removed for de-identification):
Names, geographic data, dates (except year), phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, SSNs, medical record numbers, health plan beneficiary numbers, account numbers, certificate/license numbers, VINs, device identifiers, URLs, IP addresses, biometric identifiers, full-face photographs, any other unique identifying number.

**De-identified data**: Remove all 18 identifiers → no longer PHI → HIPAA doesn't apply.

## HIPAA Security Rule Safeguards (for ePHI)

### Administrative Safeguards
- [ ] Security Officer designated
- [ ] Risk analysis performed and documented (annually)
- [ ] Workforce training on PHI handling
- [ ] Access management procedures
- [ ] Incident response procedures

### Physical Safeguards
- [ ] Facility access controls
- [ ] Workstation controls (clean desk, locked screens)
- [ ] Device and media controls (encryption, disposal policy)

### Technical Safeguards
- [ ] Access controls (unique user IDs, automatic logoff)
- [ ] Audit controls (logging access to ePHI)
- [ ] Integrity controls (verify ePHI hasn't been altered improperly)
- [ ] Transmission security (encryption in transit)

## HIPAA Breach Notification Rule

A "breach" = unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of unsecured PHI that compromises security or privacy.

**Notification timeline:**
- Individuals: Notify within 60 days of discovery
- HHS: Notify within 60 days (or after year-end for breaches < 500 individuals)
- Media: If breach affects > 500 in a state — notify prominent media within 60 days

## HITECH Act

HITECH (2009) strengthened HIPAA:
- Extended HIPAA obligations directly to Business Associates
- Significantly increased penalty tiers
- Added breach notification requirements

## Penalty Tiers

| Tier | Situation | Per Violation |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | Unknowing violation | $100–$50,000 |
| Tier 2 | Reasonable cause | $1,000–$50,000 |
| Tier 3 | Willful neglect, corrected | $10,000–$50,000 |
| Tier 4 | Willful neglect, uncorrected | $50,000 |
| Annual cap | Per violation category | $1.9M |

## HIPAA Compliance Roadmap for SaaS Vendors

1. Determine if you're a Business Associate
2. Sign BAAs with cloud infrastructure providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
3. Complete and document a risk analysis
4. Implement required administrative, physical, and technical safeguards
5. Train workforce on HIPAA obligations
6. Create breach response plan
7. Sign BAAs with covered entity customers
8. Consider HITRUST certification for enterprise sales credibility

## Output Format

Deliver:
- HIPAA applicability assessment (Covered Entity vs. Business Associate vs. neither)
- Required safeguards gap analysis against checklist
- BAA requirement checklist
- Breach response plan outline
- Priority remediation steps
