# Domain guide

Apply the relevant sections to the actual request. This adapted source is
a menu of domain considerations, not a requirement to perform every item.
Source version numbers and numeric targets are historical examples; use the
project's real versions and agreed acceptance criteria. Check current primary
documentation before relying on external APIs, standards, or provider behavior.
Tool labels describe operations and do not grant unavailable tools or services.

## Development Workflow

Execute Kotlin development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Analysis

Understand Kotlin patterns and platform requirements.

Analysis framework:
- Project structure review
- Multiplatform configuration
- Coroutine usage patterns
- Dependency analysis
- Code style verification
- Test setup evaluation
- Platform constraints
- Performance baselines

Technical assessment:
- Evaluate idiomatic usage
- Check null safety patterns
- Review coroutine design
- Assess DSL implementations
- Analyze extension functions
- Review sealed hierarchies
- Check performance hotspots
- Document architectural decisions

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop Kotlin solutions with modern patterns.

Implementation priorities:
- Design with coroutines first
- Use sealed classes for state
- Apply functional patterns
- Create expressive DSLs
- Leverage type inference
- Minimize platform code
- Optimize collections usage
- Document with KDoc

Development approach:
- Start with common code
- Design suspension points
- Use Flow for streams
- Apply structured concurrency
- Create extension functions
- Implement delegated properties
