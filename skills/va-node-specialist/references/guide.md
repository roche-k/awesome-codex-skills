# Domain guide

Apply the relevant sections to the actual request. This adapted source is
a menu of domain considerations, not a requirement to perform every item.
Source version numbers and numeric targets are historical examples; use the
project's real versions and agreed acceptance criteria. Check current primary
documentation before relying on external APIs, standards, or provider behavior.
Tool labels describe operations and do not grant unavailable tools or services.

Node.js development checklist:
- Package.json correctly configured
- Asynchronous code properly handled
- Error boundaries established
- Memory management optimized
- Security best practices implemented
- Logging configured appropriately
- Environment variables secured
- Graceful shutdown implemented

Node.js core mastery:
- Event Loop deep understanding
- Stream API and buffers
- File System (fs/promises)
- Child Processes and Worker Threads
- Clustering and IPC
- Events and EventEmitter
- HTTP/HTTPS modules
- Native addons and N-API

Asynchronous patterns:
- Promise and async/await mastery
- Error handle first callbacks
- Event-driven architecture
- Promise.allSettled and race
- AsyncLocalStorage usage
- Top-level await

Performance optimization:
- Memory leak detection and prevention
- Event loop blockage prevention
- Garbage collection tuning
- Stream processing instead of buffering
- Connection pooling
- Caching strategies (Redis, Memcached)
- Profiling with Node built-in tools

Security practices:
- OWASP Top 10 mitigation
- npm audit and dependency vetting
- CORS and helmet configuration
- Rate limiting and DDoD protection
- JWT and session management
- Secure password hashing (Argon2, bcrypt)
- Input validation and sanitization

Framework ecosystem:
- Express.js and Fastify architecture
- NestJS dependency injection
- GraphQL servers (Apollo/Mercurius)
- ORMs/Query Builders (Prisma, TypeORM, Drizzle, Knex)
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, BullMQ, Kafka)
- WebSockets (Socket.io, ws)

## Development Workflow

### 1. Code Analysis

Understand existing backend patterns and structure.

Analysis priorities:
- Dependency evaluation and audit
- Async code structure
- Middleware architecture
- Database connection lifecycle
- Error handling patterns
- Security posture

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop robust backend solutions.

Implementation approach:
- Optimize I/O bound operations
- Setup proper logging (Pino/Winston)
- Implement validation (Zod/Joi)
- Construct proper error classes
- Implement graceful degradation
- Setup thorough unit and integration testing

### 3. Quality Assurance

Ensure the backend is production-ready.

Quality verification:
- High load testing passing
- Memory footprint stable
- Security audits clear
- Error tracking integrated
- Zero-downtime deployment ready

Always prioritize scalability, system stability, and I/O performance while leveraging the Node.js event-driven architecture.
