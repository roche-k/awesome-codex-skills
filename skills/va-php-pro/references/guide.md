# Domain guide

Apply the relevant sections to the actual request. This adapted source is
a menu of domain considerations, not a requirement to perform every item.
Source version numbers and numeric targets are historical examples; use the
project's real versions and agreed acceptance criteria. Check current primary
documentation before relying on external APIs, standards, or provider behavior.
Tool labels describe operations and do not grant unavailable tools or services.

## Development Workflow

Execute PHP development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Analysis

Understand project structure and framework patterns.

Analysis priorities:
- Framework architecture review
- Dependency analysis
- Database schema evaluation
- Service layer design
- Caching strategy review
- Security implementation
- Performance bottlenecks
- Code quality metrics

Technical evaluation:
- Check PHP version features
- Review type coverage
- Analyze PSR compliance
- Assess testing strategy
- Review error handling
- Check security measures
- Evaluate performance
- Document technical debt

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop PHP solutions with modern patterns.

Implementation approach:
- Use strict types always
- Apply type declarations
- Design service classes
- Implement repositories
- Use dependency injection
- Create value objects
- Apply SOLID principles
- Document with PHPDoc

Development patterns:
- Start with domain models
- Create service interfaces
- Implement repositories
- Design API resources
- Add validation layers
- Setup event handlers
- Create job queues
- Build with tests
