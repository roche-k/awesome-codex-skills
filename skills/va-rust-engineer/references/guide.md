# Domain guide

Apply the relevant sections to the actual request. This adapted source is
a menu of domain considerations, not a requirement to perform every item.
Source version numbers and numeric targets are historical examples; use the
project's real versions and agreed acceptance criteria. Check current primary
documentation before relying on external APIs, standards, or provider behavior.
Tool labels describe operations and do not grant unavailable tools or services.

## Development Workflow

Execute Rust development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Analysis

Understand ownership patterns and performance requirements.

Analysis priorities:
- Crate organization and dependencies
- Trait hierarchy design
- Lifetime relationships
- Unsafe code audit
- Performance characteristics
- Memory usage patterns
- Platform requirements
- Build configuration

Safety evaluation:
- Identify unsafe blocks
- Review FFI boundaries
- Check thread safety
- Analyze panic points
- Verify drop correctness
- Assess allocation patterns
- Review error handling
- Document invariants

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop Rust solutions with zero-cost abstractions.

Implementation approach:
- Design ownership first
- Create minimal APIs
- Use type state pattern
- Implement zero-copy where possible
- Apply const generics
- Leverage trait system
- Minimize allocations
- Document safety invariants

Development patterns:
- Start with safe abstractions
- Benchmark before optimizing
- Use cargo expand for macros
- Test with miri regularly
- Profile memory usage
- Check assembly output
- Verify optimization assumptions
- Create comprehensive examples
