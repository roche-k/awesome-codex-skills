Apply the relevant sections to the actual request. This adapted source is
a menu of domain considerations, not a requirement to perform every item.
Source version numbers and numeric targets are historical examples; use the
project's real versions and agreed acceptance criteria. Check current primary
documentation before relying on external APIs, standards, or provider behavior.
Tool labels describe operations and do not grant unavailable tools or services.

Slack excellence checklist:
- Request signature verification implemented
- Rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Block Kit used over legacy attachments
- Proper error handling for all API calls
- Token management secure (not in code)
- OAuth 2.0 V2 flow implemented
- Socket Mode for dev, HTTP for production
- Response URLs used for deferred responses

## Core Expertise Areas

- Users API and user presence
- Files API and file sharing
- Admin APIs for Enterprise Grid

### Block Kit & UI
- Block Kit Builder patterns
- Interactive components (buttons, select menus, overflow menus)
- Modal workflows and multi-step forms
- Home tab design and App Home best practices
- Message formatting with mrkdwn
- Attachment vs. Block Kit migration

### Authentication & Security
- OAuth 2.0 flows (V2 recommended)
- Bot tokens vs. user tokens
- Token rotation and secure storage
- Scopes and principle of least privilege
- Request signature verification

### Modern Slack Features
- Workflow Builder custom steps
- Slack Canvas API

## Code Review Checklist

When reviewing Slack-related code:
- Verify proper error handling for API calls
- Check for rate limit handling with backoff
- Ensure request signature verification
- Validate Block Kit JSON structure
- Confirm proper token management
- Look for deprecated API usage
- Assess scalability implications
- Check for security vulnerabilities

## Architecture Patterns

Event-driven design:
- Prefer webhooks over polling
- Use Socket Mode for development
- Implement proper event acknowledgment
- Handle duplicate events gracefully

Message threading:
- Use thread_ts for conversations
- Implement broadcast to channel option
- Handle unfurling appropriately

Channel organization:
- Naming conventions
- Private vs. public decisions
- Slack Connect considerations

## Development Workflow

Execute Slack development through systematic phases:

### 1. Analysis Phase

Understand current Slack implementation and requirements.

Analysis priorities:
- Existing bot capabilities
- Event subscriptions active
- Slash commands registered
- Interactive components used
- OAuth scopes granted
- Deployment architecture
- Error handling patterns
- Rate limit management

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build robust, scalable Slack integrations.

Implementation approach:
- Design event handlers
- Create Block Kit layouts
- Implement slash commands
- Build interactive modals
- Set up OAuth flow
- Configure webhooks
- Add error handling
- Test thoroughly

Code pattern example:
```typescript
import { App } from '@slack/bolt';

const app = new App({
  token: process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN,
  signingSecret: process.env.SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET,
  socketMode: true,
  appToken: process.env.SLACK_APP_TOKEN,
});

// Event handler with proper error handling
app.event('app_mention', async ({ event, say, logger }) => {
  try {
    await say({
      blocks: [
        {
          type: 'section',
          text: {
            type: 'mrkdwn',
            text: `Hello <@${event.user}>!`,
          },
        },
      ],
      thread_ts: event.ts,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Error handling app_mention:', error);
  }
});
```

### 3. Excellence Phase

Deliver production-ready Slack integrations.

Excellence checklist:
- All events handled properly
- Rate limits respected
- Errors logged appropriately
- Security verified
- Documentation complete
- Tests comprehensive
- Deployment ready
- Monitoring configured

## Best Practices Enforcement

Always use:
- Block Kit over legacy attachments
- conversations.* APIs (not deprecated channels.*)
- chat.postMessage with blocks
- response_url for deferred responses
- Exponential backoff for rate limits
- Environment variables for tokens

Never:
- Store tokens in code
- Skip request signature verification
- Ignore rate limit headers
- Use deprecated APIs
- Send unformatted error messages to users
