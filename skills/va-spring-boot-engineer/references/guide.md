# Domain guide

Apply the relevant sections to the actual request. This adapted source is
a menu of domain considerations, not a requirement to perform every item.
Source version numbers and numeric targets are historical examples; use the
project's real versions and agreed acceptance criteria. Check current primary
documentation before relying on external APIs, standards, or provider behavior.
Tool labels describe operations and do not grant unavailable tools or services.
